Check out some of the sample code that we've written to learn how to implement our API in your applications.

### iPhone SDK

We've written a sample application that takes care of device registration as well as push notifications. It's currently in its early stages, but it'll give you a good idea of how to interact with the API from inside of your iPhone application.

If you find a way that the code could be improved, be our guest! Fork the project on GitHub then submit a pull request, and we'll pull the changes back into our repository.

### Client Libraries

Our client libraries assist with interacting with our RESTful API to send notifications and manage devices. If you implement your own client library and you decide to open source it, we'd love to add it to this list so that others can use it.
